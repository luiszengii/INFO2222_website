# Week 1


## 4th March 2021 (Thursday)

### The first pre group up meeting

#### Reasons for meeting:
After the first class, we contacted each other and talked about the work content. 
So on Thursday night, we completed the pre-planned four-person team task. After that, we conducted a brief discussion on our group work.

#### Members: 
Yifan, Jingtao, Luis, An

#### Notes for meeting:
- Confirmed that the leader of our group is Luis.
- Simply clarify the general division of work of our group and the work intentions of this semester, which are relatively preliminary.
- Established a group chat of our own, agreed to contact at any time through the group chat and discuss the weekly group meeting regularly in the group.



## 6th March 2021 (Saturday)

### Query relevant information in class
#### Overview:
Simply based on the three ppt mentioned in the class, I checked the relevant knowledge after the class. 
The speed in the class feels generally fast, so after class, I checked and reviewed some of the knowledge that appeared in the slides, and also simply expanded some related information.

#### Content:
- Regarding the definition of usability, I briefly searched on Wikipedia and saw two introductions  that appeared on slides and some related information. 
The page includes some information about the ISO organization as well. In my opinion, the main focus of usability is also to meet the needs of users. 
Whether it is the user’s ease of use or the user’s satisfaction after using, it is all in order to meet the customers’ demand.
- Regarding the mental model, I conducted some related queries and learned that it is the basis for us to build the model of communication later.
- For two tools: Pact and Catwoe, after I personally checked some information, I feel that Pact may be a more useful tool.
Because the first of them -- people, compared to Catwoe, which is divided into actors and customers, which emphasizes more ‘Everyone’ has different roles in a project, and their different needs need to be met with each other.

# week2
## 8th March 2021 (Monday)

### Group meeting notes #1
Tutorial session: Monday 1 pm - 3 pm
Members presented: Alex, Jason, Hogo, Yifan, Luis
Members absent: none

#### Meeting notes:
In our first meeting, we greeted each other and had a brief introduction about ourselves. 
After we were well acquainted with our team members, we created our group's representative persona. We decided the persona to be an overseas Chinese student majoring in computer science and wish to achieve a good result in this unit.

#### Thoughts:
We found it extremely useful for us individuals to make decisions when not sure what other team members' opinion because the persona well represented us as a group.

#### Technical Work
Help all the team members with windows system setting up windows subsystem Linux. We also got familiar with some basic commands in the Linux terminal and tried out the python web framework bottle to route some webpages through local ports.

## Group Project Meeting #1
#### Time: 9th March 2021 (Tuesday)
#### People: all group members
#### Group discussion:
#### Users and characteristics
We read through the project brief, and our preliminary determination of our users is students in USYD who wish to learn about how to build up their web page quickly. These students may come from different faculties with a variety of academic backgrounds. We think it may be user-friendly if we could provide the user with an option of whether they are beginners or have some basic web development knowledge. 
#### Steps user will take
To start with the website, the users would be asked if they are beginners or not. If "I am not a beginner" is clicked, the entire content will present to the user, and the user can learn whatever piece of knowledge he/she needs. If "I am a beginner " is selected, the website will begin to teach from the basics.
As for user login, we decide the best way to handle it without annoying the users at an early stage is to let the users choose if they want to stay in the tourist mode, which limits some of the functions of the website while leaving most of the tutorial available to watch
During the tutorial, users can freely place bookmarks for a later visit to the website.
The necessity of being affiliated with USYD remains to be discussed after the user investigation is conducted.
The users are expected to view web development contents in the forms of text, pictures, and videos.
Our PACT analysis is on the kanban created in the GitHub "project page"

Group discussion notes:

We asked future users about how they wish to learn about web development which may consist of heave code. Most of them wish to learn by watching videos since it is the most intuitional way to perceive how coding works. 
the Persona of our user group:
- based on the data collected above, we come up with the persona:
- No basic knowledge about JavaScript or CSS
- Prefer to directly search problems they met on Internet.
- Prefer to video teaching but not text
- No obvious bias towards whether link to usyd page or not
- Enthusiastic. Willing to answer others questions and leave their opinions about using for developers.
- Care more about the content of my learning than the UI
