### Query relevant information in class
#### Overview:
Simply based on the three ppt mentioned in the class, I checked the relevant knowledge after the class. 
The speed in the class feels generally fast, so after class, I checked and reviewed some of the knowledge that appeared in the slides, and also simply expanded some related information.

#### Content:
- Regarding the definition of usability, I briefly searched on Wikipedia and saw two introductions  that appeared on slides and some related information. 
The page includes some information about the ISO organization as well. In my opinion, the main focus of usability is also to meet the needs of users. 
Whether it is the user’s ease of use or the user’s satisfaction after using, it is all in order to meet the customers’ demand.
- Regarding the mental model, I conducted some related queries and learned that it is the basis for us to build the model of communication later.
- For two tools: Pact and Catwoe, after I personally checked some information, I feel that Pact may be a more useful tool.
Because the first of them -- people, compared to Catwoe, which is divided into actors and customers, which emphasizes more ‘Everyone’ has different roles in a project, and their different needs need to be met with each other.
